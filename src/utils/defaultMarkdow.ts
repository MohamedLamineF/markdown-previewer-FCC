the rest of file is just example of markdown text:
Here's some code, \`<div>Hello World!</div>\`, between two backticks.

\`\`\`javascript
// this is multi-line code:

function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
  if (firstLine === '\`\`\`' && lastLine === '\`\`\`') {
    return multiLineCode;
  }
}
\`\`\`

You can also make text **bold**... whoa!
Or _italic_.
Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.

There's also [links](https://www.freecodecamp.org), and
> Block Quotes!

And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:

| Wild Header    | Crazy Header   | Another Header? |
| -------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Your content can | be here, and it | can be here.... |
| And here.      | Okay.          | I think we get it. |

- And of course there are lists.
  - Some are bulleted.
    - With different indentation levels.
      - That look like this.

1. And there are numbered lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want!
1. And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:
